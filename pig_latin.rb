# Method name: pig_latin
# Inputs:      A string representing a single word (i.e., no spaces)
# Returns:     The word translated into "pig latin"
# Prints:      Nothing

# Note #1
# There are two rules for translating something into "pig latin":
#   1. If a word begins with a consonant or sequence of consonants, move the
#      sequence of consonants  to the end of the word and then append "ay"
#   2. If a word begins with a vowel, just append "ay"
#
# See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin#Rules
#
# Here are some examples:
# pig_latin("happy") == "appyhay"
